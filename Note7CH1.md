  What is a Database: A database is a shared collection of related data used to support the activities of a particular organization; Database properties encompass representing real-world information, maintaining logical coherence, serving a specific purpose, organizing data into fields and tables, and accommodating multiple tables for various data management needs.
  Database Management System: A DBMS is software that helps users create and manage databases, ensuring convenient and efficient data storage and retrieval, as seen in a traditional banking system.
  Characteristics and Benefits of a Database: Managing information through a database system enhances accessibility, organization, and versatility, enabling us to efficiently perform tasks like creating lists, generating reports, and linking data for various purposes.
  elational Databases: The relational data model, introduced by C. F. Codd in 1970 and currently the most widely used data model, forms the foundation for database theory, design methodologies, SQL, and modern commercial database management systems, representing the world as interconnected tables of data.
  Fundamental Concepts in the Relational Data Model: Relation; Table; Column; Domain; Records; Degree
  Non-relational Databases: Non-relational databases, or NoSQL databases, have emerged to handle the storage of diverse and unstructured data, such as document-oriented databases, which store data in a semi-structured "document" format, alongside other non-relational database types like graph-based, column-based, and key-value stores.
  What is NoSQL: NoSQL is a database approach that diverges from traditional relational databases, offering more flexible data models to handle the performance, scalability, and storage needs of modern, data-intensive applications, particularly for unstructured data types like user data, chat logs, time series data, and multimedia content.
  TYPES OF NOSQL DATABASES: NoSQL databases encompass four main categories: key-value stores for flexible non-transactional data, document stores for storing self-describing documents, wide-column stores for efficient retrieval of related data, and graph stores for relationship-centric data, with multi-modal databases combining these categories for broader application support.
  Query for Data: Data retrieval from a database, known as a query, varies depending on the database type, with SQL being the predominant language for performing actions like selecting, inserting, updating, and deleting data in relational databases.

  Choosing the Right Database Solution:The concept emphasizes the importance of selecting the right type of database (Relational or NoSQL) for a software project, highlighting that the choice can significantly impact performance and scalability, and it's crucial for both beginners and experienced developers to make informed decisions.
  Relational DBs (SQL based): A relational database is a structured collection of interconnected tables that store data in a way that allows for efficient querying using SQL-like languages, with predefined schemas, and common examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and MS SQL Server.
  Columnar DBs: Columnar databases, like Cassandra, excel in efficiently handling queries on specific subsets of columns, making them ideal for data science and log storage applications.
  Key-value DBs: Key-value databases are fast and efficient for data retrieval using unique keys, making them ideal for caching and other applications that require quick querying, but they lack support for complex queries across records.
  Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS): Amazon RDS is a managed relational database service offering various database engines, streamlining routine tasks, enabling replication for improved reliability, and adopting a pay-as-you-go pricing model.
  What is an Amazon RDS DB Instance: Amazon RDS is a cloud-based database service where DB instances serve as isolated environments for multiple databases, each running a specific DB engine, customizable in terms of CPU, memory, storage, and VPC usage, all managed by Amazon RDS.
